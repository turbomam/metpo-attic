    print("""
For EXCELLENT matches (similarity ≥ 0.75, distance < 0.25):
  → ~5-8 ontologies provide 90%+ coverage
  → micro, upheno, mpo, n4l_merged, oba are the core set

For VERY GOOD matches (similarity ≥ 0.70, distance < 0.30):
  → ~8-10 ontologies needed for 90% coverage

This is FAR less than the 24 ontologies we tested in ChromaDB.
The testing identified which ones have high-quality matches.

IMPORT vs MAP decision:
  - Importing 8-10 ontologies: complex integration, conflicts, maintenance
  - METPO with SSSOM mappings: structural independence, clean hierarchies
  - Both approaches achieve interoperability, but METPO maintains focus
